## What Should You Do If req.user Is Undefined?
If you're seeing errors where req.user is undefined, it could mean that:

No Authentication Middleware: You might not have added an authentication middleware that populates req.user. Ensure you have proper authentication setup before you access req.user.

Missing Authorization Header or Token: If you're using JWT, make sure the client is sending the token correctly in the request header (usually in the Authorization header as Bearer <token>).
